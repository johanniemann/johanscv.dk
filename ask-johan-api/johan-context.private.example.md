# Ask Johan Private Context Template

This is a template only.
Do not put API keys, tokens, or secrets in this file.
Keep real private context local (gitignored) and use `.env` for secrets.

Use this as a starting point for your private context file.

Recommended local file:
- `ask-johan-api/johan-context.private.md` (gitignored)

Recommended hosted option:
- Render secret env var `JOHAN_CONTEXT_B64`

Include only information you want Ask Johan to use.
