# Legacy Notes

This repository keeps an older prototype frontend in:

- `archive/legacy-frontend-prototype/root-src/`
- `archive/root-public-placeholders/`

These folders are currently retained for reference only.

They are **not** part of active build/deploy pipelines:

- CI builds `johanscv/` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Render deploy uses `johanscv.dk-api/` (`render.yaml`)

If you plan cleanup, move legacy code incrementally and verify active app behavior after each step.
